# AutoPDFUploader
 AutoPDFUploader automates the uploading of PDF files to an S3 bucket. When a PDF file is downloaded into a designated local folder, an AWS Lambda function detects the change and triggers the upload process, ensuring that your PDFs are securely stored in the cloud without manual intervention.
